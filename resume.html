               <p id = "homeParagraph"> 
                    My name is Sukya. I am a junior studying Cognitive Science 
                    and Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania. I currently 
                    am the Head Teaching Assistant for CIS 1100, Introduction to 
                    Computer Programming. I am also a Research Technician in the Betley 
                    laboratory, focused on investigating the role of various neural networks
                    on hunger. Lastly, I am an advising fellow with Matriculate, a non-profit, focused 
                    on assisting low income students with the college application process. 
               <br> 
               <br>
                    I actively searching for software engineering internships for the summer 2024 and 
                    professional development opportunities. 
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    Please take a look at some of my projects and experiences and peruse my resume. Thank you!
